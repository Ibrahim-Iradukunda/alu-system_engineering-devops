Task 0 - Run Software as Another User
Objective: Write a script that accepts a username as an argument and runs the whoami command as that user. You will use sudo to switch users.

Task 1 - Run Nginx as Nginx User
Objective: Modify the Nginx configuration so that it runs as the nginx user instead of root, and ensure it listens on port 8080 for all active IPs. You'll need to adjust the configuration files and use sed or similar commands to make the necessary changes.

Notes:

Both scripts should be executable and have the correct shebang (#!/usr/bin/env bash).

Ensure the scripts pass ShellCheck without errors and include a README.md file for the project.
