Task 0 - Strace is Your Friend
Objective: Debug a 500 Internal Server Error on a WordPress site by using strace and then automate the fix using Puppet.

Debugging with strace:

Issue: You need to figure out why Apache is returning a 500 error. strace can help you track system calls and signals of processes.

Steps:

Use strace on Apache to see the system calls related to the error.

Identify the issue (e.g., missing files, permissions, misconfigurations).

Fix the error by applying the correct changes (e.g., adjusting file permissions, installing missing packages, etc.).

Puppet Automation:

Once you identify and fix the issue manually, automate it using Puppet.

The Puppet manifest 0-strace_is_your_friend.pp should include code that applies the fix (like correcting file permissions, ensuring required packages are installed, etc.).

Requirements:

Your Puppet manifest must solve the issue you found with strace.

Use Puppet resources (like file, package, exec, etc.) to fix the error automatically.

Example Flow:

Run curl -sI 127.0.0.1 to confirm the 500 error.

Use strace to find the root cause of the issue.

Apply a Puppet script to fix the issue (like correcting permissions or file paths).

Re-test by running curl -sI 127.0.0.1:80 to ensure it returns a 200 OK.

Puppet Manifest:

In your manifest 0-strace_is_your_friend.pp, ensure the first line is a comment describing the purpose of the manifest.

The script should execute successfully and fix the issue when run with puppet apply.
